# Flow (Short for Unity Workflow)

This is a small collection of Editor Extensions I wrote during my work with Unity.

Current Extensions:
* QuickScene
* QuickFile

## QuickScene (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O)

Can also be found under Window/QuickScene - but why would you ...
Shortcut: (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O)

### IMPORTANT

Do not dock this one as it gets closed on selection anyway.

### Description

Small Dialog to help you quickly switch between scenes. 
Especially useful if you use scenes for like editing prefabs.

Keyboard Control:
Up-Arrow/Down-Arrow to move selection.
Enter to Select.
Esc to close.

## QuickFile (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E)

Shortcut: (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E)

### IMPORTANT

Do not dock this one as it gets closed on selection anyway.


### Description

Small Dialog to help you easily open & select files in the inspector / open a file.
Search bar allows some barebone Regex (Sadly, "\*" does not work :/ )

Keyboard Control is also enabled:

Up-Arrow/Down-Arrow to move selection.
Enter to Select.
Shift+Enter to Open the file with representative Tool.
Esc to close.
